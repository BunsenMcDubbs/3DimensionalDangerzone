3DimensionalDangerzone
======================
TO RUN: run the UniverseFrame main

Click to start and stop continuous rotation (cycles through modes)
Click and drag to rotate by yourself (only rotates on Y and Z axis for mouse movement)
Dots are at the vertices and the origin

y axis is horizontal
z axis is vertical
x axis attacks the viewer (perpendicular to screen)

UniverseFrame is just the frame
TresSpace manages the UI (Mouse, Timer etc) and holds all of the ThreeShapes
Math is done by individual vertices
